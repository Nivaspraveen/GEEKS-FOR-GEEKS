**Difficulty:** Easy    **Accuracy:** 54.1% **Submissions:** 9K+    **Points:** 2

You are given an array A (distinct integers) of size N, and you are also given a sum. You need to find if two numbers in A exists that have sum equal to the given sum.

### Input Format:
The first line of input contains T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains three lines of input. The first line contains N denoting the size of the array A. The second line contains N elements of the array. The third line contains element sum.

### Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print  "1"(without quotes) if any pair found, othwerwise print "0"(without quotes) if not found.

##### Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the provided function sumExists.

#### Constraints:
*1 <= T <= 100*
*1 <= N <= 1000*
*1 <= Ai <= 106*

#### Examples:

#### Input:
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
14

#### Output:
1
