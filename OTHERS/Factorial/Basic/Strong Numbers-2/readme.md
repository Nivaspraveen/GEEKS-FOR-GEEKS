**Strong Numbers** are the numbers whose sum of factorial of digits is equal to the original number. Given a number N, the task is to check if it is a Strong Number or not. Print 1 if the Number is Strong, else Print 0.

*Example 1:*

**Input:** 145

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** 1! + 4! + 5! = 145 So, 145 is a Strong Number and therefore the Output 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 14
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** 1! + 4! = 25 So, 14 isn't a Strong Number and therefore the Output "NO".
 

**Your Task:**
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isStrong() which takes an Integer N as input and returns the answer.
 

**Expected Time Complexity :** O(|N|)
**Expected Space Complexity:** O(1)
 

**Constraints:**
*1 <= N <= 108*
