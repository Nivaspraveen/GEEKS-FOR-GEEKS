**Primorial of a number**

**Difficulty:** Easy    **Accuracy:** 36.04%    **Submissions:** 4K+    **Points:** 2

Given a number n, the task is to calculate its primorial. Primorial of a number is similar to factorial of a number. In primorial, not all the natural numbers get multiplied; only prime numbers are multiplied to calculate the primorial of a number. It is denoted with P#.

*Example 1:*

**Input:**
N = 5

**Output:** 30

**Explanation:**

Priomorial = 2 * 3 * 5 = 30

As a side note, factorial is 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
 

*Example 2:*

**Input:**
N = 12

**Output:** 2310

**Your Task:**  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function primorial() which takes the integer N as input parameters and returns the primorial of number n. Since the answer can be quite large print it modulo 109+7.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N*sqrt(N))
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

 

**Constraints:**
*1 ≤ N ≤ 105*
