**Difficulty:** Easy    **Accuracy:** 76.7% **Submissions:** 12K+   **Points:** 2

Given N  pairs of rectangles, where each pair denotes the length L and breadth B of the ith rectangle. The task is to return the maximum area of the rectangle.

*Example 1:*

**Input:**

N = 3

rect[] = {{1,2},
          {3,4},
          {5,6}}

**Output:**30

**Explanation:**

1. Total area of Rect. 1 = 1 * 2 = 2

2. Total area of Rect. 2 = 3 * 4 = 12

3. Total area of Rect. 3 = 5 * 6 = 30

4. Out of all rectangles, Rectangle 3 has the maximum area.

*Example 2:*

**Input:**

N = 2

rect[] = {{12,3},
          {40,5}} 

**Output:**200

**Explanation:**

1. Total area of Rect. 1 = 12 * 3 = 36

2. Total area of Rect. 2 = 40 * 5 = 200.

3. Out of all rectangles, Rectangle 2 has the maximum area.

**User Task:** Your task is to complete the function calculate_Area() which returns maximum area. Use area() function in Rectangle class.

**Constraints:**

*1 <= N <= 103*

*1 <= L, B <= 104*

*1 <= Area <= 108*
