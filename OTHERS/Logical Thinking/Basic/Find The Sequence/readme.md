Adobe is weak in the concepts of string. He is given a number N and has to find N terms of that series. The series is 1, 2, 5, 8,15. . . 

#### Example 1:

#### Input:
N = 8

#### Output:
1 2 5 8 15 28 51 94

#### Explanation:
For N = 8, series comes out to be: 1 2 5 8 15 28 51 94

#### Example 2:

#### Input:
N = 3

#### Output:
1 2 5 

#### Explanation:
For N = 3, series comes out to be: 1 2 5 

##### Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function printSeries() which takes an integer N as input parameter and return the list of the first N term of the series.

#### Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
#### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

#### Constraints:
*1 <= N <= 50*
