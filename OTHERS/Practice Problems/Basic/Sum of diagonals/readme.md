Given a square of matrix M of size N * N. You task is to compute and return sum of principal diagonal elements of matrix. Your have to complete the function diagonalSum() which accepts N (size of matrix, N*N) and matrix M[ ][ ] as arguments.

**Input:**
The first input line contains T, denoting the number of testcases. Each testcase contains two lines. The first line contains N (size of matrix). The second line contains N*N elements of matrix separated by space.

**Output:**
For each testcase in new line, print the sum of diagonal elements.

**User Task:**
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the function sumDiagonal().

**Constraints:**

*1 <= T <= 100*

*1 <= N <= 50*

*1 <= M[i][j] <= 100*

*Example:*

**Input:**

1

3

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

*Output:*
15

**Explanation:**

*Testcase 1:* Sum of diagonal elements are: 1+5+9 = 15.
