*Let's learn about CPP strings here. CPP strings are quite different from their C counterpart and have various methods that can be invoked on them. We hope you've read the articles.*

You are given a string s containing only lowercase letters. You need to count the number of vowels and the number of consonants.

###### If vowel count > consonant count then print - Yes(without quotes).
###### If vowel count < consonant count then print - No(without quotes).
###### If vowel count = consonant count then print - Same(without quotes).

#### Example 1:

### Input:
s = "aaaaaa"

### Output:
Yes

#### Example 2:

### Input:
s = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

### Output:
No

##### Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the function checkString(string s) that take s as input and produces output. In a new line, print the output.

#### Constraints:
*1 <= |s| <= 100*
