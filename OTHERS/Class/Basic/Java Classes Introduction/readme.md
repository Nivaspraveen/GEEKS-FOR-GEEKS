Create class named Cuboid with fields length,width and height. Calculate volume of the cuboid.

Class Cuboid contains following functions:
1. **set_height(int l):** sets the length of the cuboid.
2. **set_width(int w):** sets width of the cuboid.
3. **set_height(int h):** sets height of the cuboid.
4. **volume():** Prints the volume of the cuboid.

### Input:
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. For each test case, three integers are given.

### Output:
For each test case, the output is the volume of the cuboid.

##### User Task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the functions given set_height(), set_width(), set_height() and volume().

#### Constraints:
*1 <= T <= 100*
*1 <= l, w, h <= 103*

#### Example:

#### Input
2
10 5 7
11 9 4

#### Output:
350
396
