CPP structs are more powerful than C structs as they are just classes with public data members. Here, we will create objects of a rectangle struct and find the maximum area of a rectangle. We have N rectangles out of which we have to find maximum area among all of them.

#### Example 1:

#### Input:
N = 4
9 8 
7 6 
5 4 
3 2

#### Output: 
72

#### Explanation:
We have N = 4, so 4 rectangle objects.
Obj1 (9,8), Obj2(7,6), Obj3(5,4), Obj4(3,2).
Area is length*breadth. So 9*8 = 72 gives maxArea.
 

##### Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the area and maxArea functions. In a new line, print the maximum area.

#### Constraints:
*1 <= length <= 100*
*1 <= breadth <= 100*
