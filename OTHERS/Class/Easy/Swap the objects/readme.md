Classes and objects are one of the most important part of C++.
Here we will learn to use classes and objects and we'll swap the values of two objects. We'll provide name, number, and height for two objects.

#### Example:

#### Input: 
Morty 1234 6
Rick 5678 5

#### Output: 
Morty 1234 6 
Rick 5678 5 
Rick 5678 5 
Morty 1234 6

#### Explanation: 
First we print the original values of obj1 and obj2 in two lines. The next two lines contain swapped values of obj1 and obj2.

#### Expected Complexities
**Time Complexity:** O(1)
**Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

#### Constraints:
*1<= |name| <= 100*
*1 <= number <= 99999*
*1 <= height <= 10*
