[Template in C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/templates-cpp/) is a feature. We write code once and use it for any data type including user defined data types. 

#### Given three cases:
    1st case when two strings are given , print the smallest of the two strings.
    2nd case when two integers are given, print the smallest of the two integers.
    3rd case when two char are given , print the smallest of the two characters(lowercase).

Your task is to complete class minElement which would include a private variable say y, a constructor which would set the given value to the private variable. And a method check() which would take one parameter say x and print the min of x and y(private variable) .

First line of each input will contain 1 integer c. Next line will contain two strings if c is equal to 1 or will contain two integers if c is equal to 2 or will contain two char if value of c is equal to 3. We have to print the lowest of the two values given.

#### Examples :

#### Input: 1
gfg spl

#### Output: gfg

#### Input: 2
5 9

#### Output: 5

#### Expected Complexities
**Time Complexity:** O(1)
**Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
