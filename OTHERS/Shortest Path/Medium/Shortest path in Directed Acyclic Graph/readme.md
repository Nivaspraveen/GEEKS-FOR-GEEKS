**Difficulty:** Medium  **Accuracy:** 48.48%    **Submissions:** 142K+  **Points:** 4

Given a Directed Acyclic Graph of V vertices from 0 to n-1 and a 2D Integer array(or vector) edges[ ][ ] of length E, where there is a directed edge from edge[i][0] to edge[i][1] with a distance of edge[i][2] for all i.

Find the shortest path from src(0) vertex to all the vertices and if it is impossible to reach any vertex, then return -1 for that vertex.

#### *Examples:*

### Input: 
V = 4, E = 2, edge = [[0,1,2],[0,2,1]]

### Output: 
[0, 2, 1, -1]

### Explanation: 
Shortest path from 0 to 1 is 0->1 with edge weight 2. Shortest path from 0 to 2 is 0->2 with edge weight 1. There is no way we can reach 3, so it's -1 for 3.

### Input: 
V = 6, E = 7, edge = [[0,1,2],[0,4,1],[4,5,4],[4,2,2],[1,2,3],[2,3,6],[5,3,1]]

### Output: 
[0, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5]

### Explanation: 
Shortest path from 0 to 1 is 0->1 with edge weight 2. Shortest path from 0 to 2 is 0->4->2 with edge weight 1+2=3. Shortest path from 0 to 3 is 0->4->5->3 with edge weight 1+4+1=6. Shortest path from 0 to 4 is 0->4 with edge weight 1.Shortest path from 0 to 5 is 0->4->5 with edge weight 1+4=5.

#### Constraint:
*1 <= V <= 100*
*1 <= E <= min((N * (N-1))/2,4000)*
*0 <= edgei,0,edgei,1 < n*
*0 <= edgei,2 <=105*

#### Expected Complexities:
###### Time Complexity: O(n + m)
###### Auxiliary Space: O(n)
