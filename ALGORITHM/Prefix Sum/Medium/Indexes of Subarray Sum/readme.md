**Indexes of Subarray Sum**

**Difficulty:** Medium  **Accuracy:** 16.5% **Submissions:** 1.7M   **Points:** 4

Given an unsorted array arr containing only non-negative integers, your task is to find a continuous subarray (a contiguous sequence of elements) whose sum equals a specified value target. You need to return the 1-based indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements of this subarray.

*Examples:*

**Input:** arr[] = [1,2,3,7,5], target = 12

**Output:** [2, 4]

**Explanation:** The sum of elements from 2nd to 4th position is 12.

**Input:** arr[] = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], target = 15,

**Output:** [1, 5]

**Explanation:** The sum of elements from 1st to 5th position is 15.

**Input:** arr[] = [7,2,1], target = 2

**Output:** [2, 2]

**Explanation:** The sum of elements from 2nd to 2nd position is 2.

**Input:** arr[] = [5,3,4], target = 2

**Output:** [-1]

**Explanation:** There is no subarray with sum 2.

**Constraints:**

*1 <= arr.size()<= 106*

*0 <= arr[i] <= 103*

*0 <= target <= 109*

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)

**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
