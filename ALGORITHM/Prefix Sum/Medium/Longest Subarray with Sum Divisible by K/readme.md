Given an array arr and a positive integer k, find the length of the longest subarray with the sum of the elements divisible by the given value k.

*Examples :*

**Input:** arr[] = [2, 7, 6, 1, 4, 5], k = 3

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The subarray is [7, 6, 1, 4] with sum 18, which is divisible by 3.

**Input:** arr[] = [-2, 2, -5, 12, -11, -1, 7], k = 3

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The subarray is [2,-5,12,-11,-1] with sum -3, which is divisible by 3.

**Input:** arr[] = [1, 2, -2], k = 2

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The subarray is [2,-2] with sum 0, which is divisible by 2.

**Constraints:**

*1 <= arr.size() <= 106*

*1 <= k <= 106*

*-106 <= arr[i] <= 106* 

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n) 

**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(n)
